								<h2>Design</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The design phase of the project will focus on conceptualising the 3D model of the gorilla, highlighting the MOSCOW requirements, initial designs of the gorilla, and the planning involved.</p>
							<h3>Project Plan:</h3>
							<p>Our team, consisting of myself, Declan, and Jason, plan to develop a 3D gorilla prototype, using a toy gorilla purchased as a reference. To start the development process, the team will use 3D scanning technology to capture the dimensions and details of the toy gorilla. After 3D scanning, the digital model will be transferred to blender, a 3D modelling software, which will be used to further refine the digital model of the gorilla and edit the gorilla to incorporate circular ball joints into its limbs. Once the final design of the gorilla has been completed, it will be 3D printed and assembled with the ball joints. Lastly, sandpaper will be used to refine the 3D model, and ensure that the ball joints can fit correctly with the limbs of the gorilla.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, a concept discussed by the team was to add a material to simulate black fur on the gorilla. Not only would this make the gorilla model seem more realistic, but also it would help simulate characteristics of a real gorilla. A glue, potentially gorilla glue, will be used to stick the fur to the gorilla model.</p>
							<h3>MOSCOW Requirements:</h3>
							<p>Must have:</p>
							<p> <ul>
								<li>Produce a functional 3D gorilla prototype.</li>
								<li>Incorporate ball joints to allow motion in the limbs.</li>

								<h2>Development</h2>

							<h3>3D Scanning Phase:</h3>

							<p>During the development process, our team chose to incorporate 3D scanning, utilising the HandySCAN3D, a commonly used 3D scanning hardware, to capture the details and dimensions of the 3D gorilla. Given the size and complexity of the toy, multiple scans were necessary, each taken from various angles and orientations to ensure complete scan coverage. VXelements, a 3D scanning software, was utilised to merge these scans into one model and correct any scanning errors. The resulting model of the scanned gorilla was then exported as an STL file, facilitating further editing and refinement in Blender.</p>

							<h3>3D Modelling with Blender:</h3>
							<p>After 3D scanning, the STL file of the gorilla was exported to Blender, a 3D modelling software which enables users to modify and reconstruct virtual models. Once exported to Blender, the body and limbs of the gorilla were modified to incorporate ball joints.</p>
							<h4>3D Body Modelling:</h4>
							<p>Firstly, the arms were removed from the from the main body of the gorilla using Blender, in order to incorporate ball joints where the arms used to be. One challenge that needed to be addressed was the large unscaled holes that were left after removing the arms. To address this, a cylindrical fill tool was used to fill the gaps where the gorilla’s arms used to be, reducing the number of sharp edges on the model, and smoothing the model so that ball joints can be incorporated in the vacant arm space.</p>
							<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/arms.png" alt="" /></a>
							<h4>3D Arm Modelling:</h4>
							<p>Once the arms had been removed from the main body of the gorilla, a Blender bridge tool was used to create holes in the arms where the ball joints should slot in. One issue that arose was the small size of the holes in the arms, preventing the ball joints from slotting into the arms. To address this issue, the team decided to use sanding paper to increase the size of the holes in the arms, this would allow the team to smooth the model once 3D printed. Furthermore, this would prevent the arm holes from being too large of size and will allow the team to refine the arm holes to a perfect size so that it can fit the ball joints.</p>
							<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/body.png" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>3D Printing Phase:</h3>
							<p>Although the plan of the team was to 3D print the model of the gorilla, due to time constraints and issues whilst modelling in blender the 3D model was not able to be printed. However, there are still some considerations that were made whilst deciding the optimal way to 3D print the model. One consideration made was the 3D printing material, the material chosen by the team was PLA (Polylactic Acid), this is due to its biodegradability, low printing temperature which reduces risk of warping, and the wide colour range that will aid in enhancing the aesthetics of the 3D gorilla (Shahrubudin, N.(2019)). Other materials that could have been used include, Nylon, ABS, or ULTEM, which each have unique properties that may be beneficial to use depending on the nature of the project. </p>
							<p>Once printed the next step would be to assemble the separate 3D printed parts, integrating the body, arms and ball joints in order to produce a functional 3D gorilla model with motion. Furthermore, after the gorilla model had been assembled, adhesive glue would be used to stick faux fur onto the gorilla, to simulate realism in the model.</p>
							<h3>Additional Considerations:</h3>
							<p>Some additional considerations that the team made include the material used as fur on the gorilla model. The material that was chosen to simulate fur was faux fur, a synthetic fur composed of polyester or acrylic fibres. Faux fur was chosen due to it’s ability to mimic the texture of real fur despite the material being synthetic, furthermore faux fur offers enhanced customisation, as it can come in a variety of different colours, patterns, and lengths. Some alternative materials that were considered for simulating fur include, cotton, recycled animal fur, and fleece.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, another consideration in the development of this project was incorporating resin to create additional details on the 3D model. However, the team decided not to use resin as it would not only be unnecessary to the project but would also require a significant amount of time to refine the details of the resin.</p>

								<h2>Development Technologies</h2>
							</header>
							<h3> <strong>3D Modelling Software:</strong></h3>
							<p>3D modelling is the process of creating three-dimensional digital representations of objects or scenes. 3D modelling software is crucial for the design and development of the 3D gorilla prototype. 3D modelling software enables users to visualise designs and concepts in three dimensions, allowing uses to create accurate models with exact measurements and dimensions. Furthermore, 3D modelling software enables cost-effective prototyping, allowing users to transform ideas to produce a functional prototype or product. Some examples of 3D modelling software tools include Blender, Sketch-up, and Fusion 360. </p>
							<p>Blender, created by Ton Roosendaal and launched in January 1995, is a 3D modelling software widely used by independent artists and animators (Mullen, T. (2013)). Blender has been chosen as the 3D modelling software that will be used to design and reconstruct the 3D gorilla once it has been 3D scanned. Blender was chosen for use in the project as it is entirely open source and supports a wide range of tools for modelling and sculpting, which will aid in producing an accurate design of the 3D gorilla. </p>
							<h3> <strong>3D Scanning Hardware and Software:</strong></h3>
							<p> 3D scanning hardware and software are technologies that are used to capture the three-dimensional shape of physical objects and environments. 3D scanning involves using specialised hardware to gather specific data points from objects or environments, which are then processed by 3D scanning software in order to generate a 3D model (Daneshmand, M. et al. (2018))</p>
							<p>Hardware used in 3D scanning typically includes sensors, cameras or laser systems that are used to capture the texture and dimensional shape of an object being scanned. These devices can range from handheld sensors to stationary laser scanners for modelling of larger objects. Due to the nature of the project, a handheld sensor will be used to capture the 3D gorilla, some examples of different handheld sensors include: EinScan Pro, Shining 3D, and the HandySCAN 3D.</p>

							<p>3D scanning softwarse process the data captured by the hardware to create a digital representation of the 3D scanned object. 3D scanning software typically includes tools for cleaning the scan data, aligning multiple scans, and generating a 3D model of the scanned object. Some examples of 3D scanning software include: VXelements, Meshlab, and Agisoft Metashape.</p>
							<h3>Computer Aided Design (CAD):</h3>
							<p>Computer Aided Design (CAD) involves any type of design activity, that uses a computer to develop, analyse or modify an engineering design (Sarcar, M.M.M (2008)). CAD software allows users to produce detailed 2D and 3D models of objects and environments, playing a large role in modern design and engineering processes. Some examples of CAD software include AutoCAD, Rhino 3D, and CATIA.</p>
							<p>Although CAD has not been used in the development of this project, it offers several features that could be beneficial whilst developing a 3D model. One feature of CAD for 3D modelling is parametric modelling, allowing users to define parameters such as dimensions, angles, and relationships, which enables users to create modifiable 3D models. Another feature of CAD is surface modelling which allows users to manipulate curves and patches to create smooth surfaces and complex 3D models (Qin, S.F (2008)).</p>
							<h3>Haptic Input and 3D Sculpting:</h3>
							<p>Haptic Input hardware consists of devices that measure forces exerted by a user on an interface, some examples of this include haptic gloves and styluses (Hayward, V(2004)). Haptic input devices allow users to physically manipulate objects in a 3D space and feel effects of resistance and weight whilst 3D sculpting. 3D sculpting software is designed to work in conjunction with haptic input hardware, providing an interface between the hardware and the user. This software enables users to sculpt and manipulate digital materials in order to create precise and realistic 3D models. Some examples of sculpting software include: </p>
							<p>Haptic input hardware and 3D sculpting software will not be used in this project due to its unavailability within the Staffordshire University Institute, and limited money resources to purchase haptic input hardware. Despite this, some benefits of using these 3D development technologies are increased precision, reduced time to develop, and users being able to interact with 3D models in an immersive way.</p>
							<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/image2.png" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>3D Printing Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</h3>
							<p>Whilst 3D printing the gorilla model, there are several considerations that need to be taken to ensure the model prints correctly.</p>
							<p> <ul>
								<li>Material: When choosing a material, several factors need to be considered including, properties, surface quality, colour, and printability. The most common 3D printing material is PLA (Polylactic Acid), which is a biodegradable polymer that’s utilised for its good printability, ease of use, and low cost (Shahrubudin, N.(2019)). Some other materials include ABS, ULTEM, and TPU, which may be used depending on the requirements of the project.</li>
								<li>Overhangs and supports: Overhangs that exceed 45 degrees need supports attached to the model to prevent it from breaking during 3D printing. However, supports may leave behind marks whilst removing them from the model, therefore additional sanding of the model can be utilised to address this.</li>
								<li>3D printing hardware: The 3D printing hardware needs to support the material that has been chosen for the project, some printers can’t support materials such as carbon. Furthermore, some 3D printers have a smaller available space to print, possibly restricting the size of the 3D model, and being unsuitable for larger projects. The last consideration is speed to print, some 3D printers may take longer to print the model.</li>
								<li>Measurements and corners: The 3D model needs to be correctly scaled before printing to ensure that there is minimal wasted material, and desired measurements for model. Furthermore, corners within the model need to be reduced to prevent components of the 3D model from cracking and to reduce the chance of injury whilst handling the model.</li>
							</ul></p>
							<h3>Laser Cutting Hardware</h3>
							<p>Laser cutting is a manufacturing process that uses a beam to cut and engrave materials. Laser cutting is used to fabricate 2D parts on 3D models designed using CAD, pieces of material are cut using a high-powered laser beam and assembled into a 3D model, or 2d parts are etched onto the model. Some examples of laser cutting hardware include Epilog laser, Trotec laser, and Boss laser.</p>
							<p>Laser cutting will not be used in this project due to money restrictions and hardware limitations, despite this there are several benefits to using laser cutting. One benefit is the precise cuts produced by the beam allow designers to create intricate and complex details on a 3D model, resulting in a more refined prototype. Another benefit is the speed of laser cutting, allowing high quality cuts to be made in a faster time than other methods such as 3D printing. </p>
							<h3>Resin Comparison:</h3>
							<p>Resin is a material commonly used in 3D printing and manufacturing, there are several types of resin that each have different properties. Some common types of resin include :</p>
							<p> <ul>
								<li>Epoxy Resin: Epoxy resin is a thermosetting resin that cures through a chemical reaction between epoxy monomers and a curing agent. Epoxy resin is widely used due to its strength, rigidness, and chemical resistance.</li>
								<li>Polyester Resin: Polyester resin is a thermosetting resin which similarly to epoxy resin, cures when mixed with a catalyst or hardener. Polyester resin is utilised due to its low cost, fast curing time, and its ability to stick to different materials.</li>
								<li>UV Resin: UV resin cures when exposed to ultraviolet light and is commonly used in 3D printing and jewellery making. UV resin is utilised due to its fast-curing time, and high resolution that can create complex details during development of the project.</li>
								<li>Acrylic Resin: This is a transparent thermoplastic resin that is used in paints and adhesives. Acrylic resin is used due to its resistance to weather and its UV stability, making it suitable for use in outdoor environments.</li>
							</ul></p>
							<p>Although resin is a versatile material and offers many different types that each have unique properties, resin will not be used in the development of this project. </p>

								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							</header>
							<h3>Future directions:</h3>
							<p>One consideration for future development of the 3D gorilla would be to increase the mobility of the 3D model. To increase the mobility of the model, further parts of the gorilla could be modified, including the neck, back two legs, and the torso, enabling the model to move smoothly. </p>
							<p>Furthermore, another future development technology that can be incorporated is laser cutting hardware, this would aid in producing a more accurate 3D model that has refined features. However, incorporating laser cutting hardware may not be suitable for larger projects, or extremely small projects, due to the large number of precise cuts required to create details on the 3D model.</p>
							<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
							<p>Although the team was not able to 3D print a physical gorilla prototype, a successful design for the 3D gorilla prototype was developed through the use of 3D scanning using the HandySCAN 3D, and 3D modelling in blender. Furthermore, a successful critical evaluation was conducted on 3D development technologies, aiding the team during the selection process of the different technologies. </p>

								<h2>Development Technologies</h2>
							</header>
							<h3> <strong>3D Modelling Software:</strong></h3>
							<p>3D modelling is the process of creating three-dimensional digital representations of objects or scenes. 3D modelling software is crucial for the design and development of the 3D gorilla prototype. 3D modelling software enables users to visualise designs and concepts in three dimensions, allowing uses to create accurate models with exact measurements and dimensions. Furthermore, 3D modelling software enables cost-effective prototyping, allowing users to transform ideas to produce a functional prototype or product. Some examples of 3D modelling software tools include Blender, Sketch-up, and Fusion 360. </p>
							<p>Blender, created by Ton Roosendaal and launched in January 1995, is a 3D modelling software widely used by independent artists and animators (ref). Blender has been chosen as the 3D modelling software that will be used to design and reconstruct the 3D gorilla once it has been 3D scanned. Blender was chosen for use in the project as it is entirely open source and supports a wide range of tools for modelling and sculpting, which will aid in producing an accurate design of the 3D gorilla. </p>
							<h3> <strong>3D Scanning Hardware and Software:</strong></h3>
							<p> 3D scanning hardware and software are technologies that are used to capture the three-dimensional shape of physical objects and environments. 3D scanning involves using specialised hardware to gather specific data points from objects or environments, which are then processed by 3D scanning software in order to generate a 3D model (ref)</p>
							<p>Hardware used in 3D scanning typically includes sensors, cameras or laser systems that are used to capture the texture and dimensional shape of an object being scanned. These devices can range from handheld sensors to stationary laser scanners for modelling of larger objects. Due to the nature of the project, a handheld sensor will be used to capture the 3D gorilla, some examples of different handheld sensors include: EinScan Pro, Shining 3D, and the HandySCAN 3D.</p>

							<p>3D scanning softwarse process the data captured by the hardware to create a digital representation of the 3D scanned object. 3D scanning software typically includes tools for cleaning the scan data, aligning multiple scans, and generating a 3D model of the scanned object. Some examples of 3D scanning software include: VXelements, Meshlab, and Agisoft Metashape.</p>
							<h3>Computer Aided Design (CAD):</h3>
							<p>Computer Aided Design (CAD) involves any type of design activity, that uses a computer to develop, analyse or modify an engineering design (Sarcar, M.M.M (2008)). CAD software allows users to produce detailed 2D and 3D models of objects and environments, playing a large role in modern design and engineering processes. Some examples of CAD software include AutoCAD, Rhino 3D, and CATIA.</p>
							<p>Although CAD has not been used in the development of this project, it offers several features that could be beneficial whilst developing a 3D model. One feature of CAD for 3D modelling is parametric modelling, allowing users to define parameters such as dimensions, angles, and relationships, which enables users to create modifiable 3D models. Another feature of CAD is surface modelling which allows users to manipulate curves and patches to create smooth surfaces and complex 3D models (Qin, S.F (2008)).</p>
							<h3>Haptic Input and 3D Sculpting:</h3>
							<p>Haptic Input hardware consists of devices that measure forces exerted by a user on an interface, some examples of this include haptic gloves and styluses (ref). Haptic input devices allow users to physically manipulate objects in a 3D space and feel effects of resistance and weight whilst 3D sculpting. 3D sculpting software is designed to work in conjunction with haptic input hardware, providing an interface between the hardware and the user. This software enables users to sculpt and manipulate digital materials in order to create precise and realistic 3D models. Some examples of sculpting software include: </p>
							<p>Haptic input hardware and 3D sculpting software will not be used in this project due to its unavailability within the Staffordshire University Institute, and limited money resources to purchase haptic input hardware. Despite this, some benefits of using these 3D development technologies are increased precision, reduced time to develop, and users being able to interact with 3D models in an immersive way.</p>
							<h3>3D Printing Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</h3>
							<p>Whilst 3D printing the gorilla model, there are several considerations that need to be taken to ensure the model prints correctly.</p>
							<p> <ul>
								<li>Material: When choosing a material, several factors need to be considered including, properties, surface quality, colour, and printability. The most common 3D printing material is PLA (Polylactic Acid), which is a biodegradable polymer thatâ€™s utilised for its good printability, ease of use, and low cost (ref). Some other materials include ABS, ULTEM, and TPU, which may be used depending on the requirements of the project.</li>
								<li>Overhangs and supports: Overhangs that exceed 45 degrees need supports attached to the model to prevent it from breaking during 3D printing. However, supports may leave behind marks whilst removing them from the model, therefore additional sanding of the model can be utilised to address this.</li>
								<li>3D printing hardware: The 3D printing hardware needs to support the material that has been chosen for the project, some printers canâ€™t support materials such as carbon. Furthermore, some 3D printers have a smaller available space to print, possibly restricting the size of the 3D model, and being unsuitable for larger projects. The last consideration is speed to print, some 3D printers may take longer to print the model.</li>
								<li>Measurements and corners: The 3D model needs to be correctly scaled before printing to ensure that there is minimal wasted material, and desired measurements for model. Furthermore, corners within the model need to be reduced to prevent components of the 3D model from cracking and to reduce the chance of injury whilst handling the model.</li>
							</ul></p>
							<h3>Laser Cutting Hardware</h3>
							<p>Laser cutting is a manufacturing process that uses a beam to cut and engrave materials. Laser cutting is used to fabricate 2D parts on 3D models designed using CAD, pieces of material are cut using a high-powered laser beam and assembled into a 3D model, or 2d parts are etched onto the model(ref). Some examples of laser cutting hardware include Epilog laser, Trotec laser, and Boss laser.</p>
							<p>Laser cutting will not be used in this project due to money restrictions and hardware limitations, despite this there are several benefits to using laser cutting. One benefit is the precise cuts produced by the beam allow designers to create intricate and complex details on a 3D model, resulting in a more refined prototype. Another benefit is the speed of laser cutting, allowing high quality cuts to be made in a faster time than other methods such as 3D printing(ref). </p>
							<h3>Resin Comparison:</h3>
							<p>Resin is a material commonly used in 3D printing and manufacturing, there are several types of resin that each have different properties. Some common types of resin include (ref):</p>
							<p> <ul>
								<li>Epoxy Resin: Epoxy resin is a thermosetting resin that cures through a chemical reaction between epoxy monomers and a curing agent. Epoxy resin is widely used due to its strength, rigidness, and chemical resistance.</li>
								<li>Polyester Resin: Polyester resin is a thermosetting resin which similarly to epoxy resin, cures when mixed with a catalyst or hardener. Polyester resin is utilised due to its low cost, fast curing time, and its ability to stick to different materials.</li>
								<li>UV Resin: UV resin cures when exposed to ultraviolet light and is commonly used in 3D printing and jewellery making. UV resin is utilised due to its fast-curing time, and high resolution that can create complex details during development of the project.</li>
								<li>Acrylic Resin: This is a transparent thermoplastic resin that is used in paints and adhesives. Acrylic resin is used due to its resistance to weather and its UV stability, making it suitable for use in outdoor environments.</li>
							</ul></p>
							<p>Although resin is a versatile material and offers many different types that each have unique properties, resin will not be used in the development of this project. </p>
